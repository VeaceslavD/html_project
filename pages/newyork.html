        <h1>Description</h1>

        <div>
            <p><b>New York City, officially named the City of New York, is the most populous city in the United States,
                    and
                    the most densely populated major city in North America.

                    The city is at the center of international finance, politics, entertainment, and culture, and is one
                    of
                    the world's major global cities (along with London, Tokyo and Paris) with a virtually unrivaled
                    collection of museums, galleries, performance venues, media outlets, international corporations, and
                    stock exchanges. The city is also home to the United Nations, along with all of the international
                    missions associated with it.

                    Located in the state of New York, New York City has a population of over 8 million within an area of
                    309
                    square miles (800 kmÂ²). It is at the heart of the New York Metropolitan Area, which is one of the
                    largest urban conglomerations in the world with a population of over 22 million. New York City
                    proper
                    comprises five boroughs: Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island, with all but the
                    last having populations exceeding one million.

                    The city includes large populations of immigrants from over 180 countries who help make it one of
                    the
                    most cosmopolitan places on earth. Many people from all over the United States are also attracted to
                    New
                    York City for its culture, energy, and diversity, and by their own hope of making it big in the "Big
                    Apple."

                <h3>Statue of Liberty</h3>

                <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USNY/new-york-city-statue-of-liberty.jpg"
                    alt="Statue of Liberty" height="200px" width="300px">
            </header>

            <p>America's most iconic sight, the Statue of Liberty is at the top of every first-time visitor's list of
                things to do in New York. It was France's gift to America. Built in 1886, it remains a world symbol of
                freedom and is one of the top attractions in America.

                It is one of the world's largest statues, standing just under 152 feet tall from the base to the torch,
                and weighing approximately 450,000 pounds. You can see the statue from land, with particularly good
                views from Battery Park, on the southern tip of Manhattan.

                To truly appreciate the Statue of Liberty, the best thing to do is to take a short boat trip to Liberty
                Island and see it up close. Take a pleasant stroll around the base, and if you have reservations, enter
                the pedestal or the crown. The crown has recently opened for tours, but book well in advance if you want
                to enjoy this special experience.

                <h3>Central Park</h3>

                <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USNY/new-york-city-central-park-lake-bridge-boats.jpg"
                    alt="Central Park" height="200px" width="300px">
            </header>

            <p>A walk, pedal, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on
                anyone's New York City itinerary. In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman
                Rink. This huge park in the city center, a half-mile wide and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that
                makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.

                Besides being a great place to experience a little nature, Central Park has many attractions within its
                borders, and most of them are free, making it one of the few cheap things to do in NYC. Some of the most
                popular places to visit include the Belvedere Castle, Strawberry Fields, the Central Park Zoo, and the
                Lake. If you are exploring the park on your own, start by picking up a map at one of the visitor centers
                and plot your route.

                <h3>Rockefeller Center & Top of the Rock Observation Deck</h3>

            </header>

            <p>When it comes to New York attractions, Rockefeller Center is on almost all tourists' itineraries. This
                vast entertainment and shopping complex in the middle of Manhattan is home to NBC-TV and other media,
                but the centerpiece is the 70-story 30 Rockefeller Plaza, an Art Deco skyscraper that offers awesome
                views over Manhattan from the famous Top of the Rock Observation Deck.

                The "deck," as it's known, includes three floors, located on the 67th, 69th, and 70th floors. Indoor and
                outdoor viewing spaces offer spectacular views by day or night. You can buy a Top of the Rock
                Observation Deck Ticket in advance. These tickets come with a flexible voucher redemption policy, so you
                can change the date if your plans change or the weather doesn't cooperate.

                Skating on the outdoor skating rink at the base of the tower is one of the most popular things to do in
                winter in New York City and a fun activity for families and couples. The rink is typically open from
                October to April. If you aren't a strong skater, don't worry, the rink is tiny, and for many people,
                this is their first time on skates, so the skill level is pretty low.

            </header>

            <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Met, as it is commonly known, was founded in 1870, and is one of
                the most famous museums in the United States. The permanent collection of The Met contains more than two
                million works of art, spanning a period of 5,000 years.

                Although the museum has three sites, the centerpiece is The Met Fifth Avenue. Highlights of this
                collection include American decorative arts, arms and armor, costumes, Egyptian art, musical
                instruments, photographs, and much more.

                Always-changing exhibitions bring some of the world's most famous works to the public.

            </header>

            <p>The Empire State Building is one of New York's most famous landmark buildings and key tourist
                attractions. The 381-meter-tall, 102-story building was the tallest in the world until the 1 World Trade
                Center tower rose higher, 41 years later. Topped with a mooring mast for airships, the Empire State
                Building immediately became a landmark and a symbol for NYC when it opened in 1931.

                There are actually two observatories atop the Empire State Building, both offering astounding views. On
                clear days, you can see up to 80 miles, looking into the neighboring states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
                Connecticut, and Massachusetts.
