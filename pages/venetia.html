        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p><b>Venice was founded over 1,500 years ago on 117 different islands that are linked by 150 canals and around
                400 bridges and pavements.
                The buildings are supported by, and built upon, oak and pine piles that are driven deep into the ground.
                They are secure because the soil is so water logged that there’s no free oxygen in it, so there’s no
                decay.
                It is a survivor
                The city exudes confidence. It is a series of islands and so is at risk of flooding, but that has never
                stopped the Venetians building the most spectacular buildings and structures here.
                It survived Napoleon, and World War 1, when it became a naval base, which increased its risk of enemy
                attack. It also came through World War 2, and an Allied attack on German naval operations in the city.
                It is a pioneer
                Venice is a pioneering city because it has been built on water. It’s a unique way to construct a city.
                But, what is also unusual is that the city seems to have had full confidence in these building methods
                because it built things like beautiful marble palaces and churches on these foundations and never
                worried about their survival.
                In a further demonstration of its pioneering status - when the plague struck, the city invented the
                concept of quarantine. It was in Venice that the ‘assembly line’ approach to manufacturing – in this
                case, shipbuilding – was invented.</b></p>

            <p>Canale Grande or Grand Canal is the most important icon of Venice- lined with gorgeous and vibrant
                looking palaces and castles on both sides. The canal is one of the best places to visit in Venice and
                meanders through the city in a zigzag way with a few breathtaking bridges built over it.
                It is one of the most popular places to visit at Venice at night, to enjoy the stunning sunset and watch
                the sparkling water of the canal.
                Don’t Miss: Thrilling and romantic Gondola ride in the Grand Canals makes it one of the must-visit
                places to visit in Venice for a honeymoon. Also, enjoy the view of the Venetian Gothic and Early
                Renaissance facades of the palaces that come off the sides.

            <p>Rialto Bridge is one of the famous landmarks of Venice- built over the Grand Canal in 1588. Besides
                linking two crowded streets of the city, the bridge is regarded as one of the best places to visit in
                Venice, Italy. It is an important crossing point of the Canal.
                Don’t Miss: Watching the gondolas and boats passing under the bridge, posing on the bridge, watching the
                adjacent fresh market, and visiting Bartolomeo – one end of the bridge.

                alt="Doge’s Palace" height="200px" width="300px">
            <p>One of the famous places to see in Venice, Doge’s Palace is an immensely beautiful and gorgeous palace,
                located on the bank of the Grand Canal. During the early days, it was the Seat of Government, the Palace
                of Justice, and the official residence of Doge. The finesse & soberness of its Venetian Gothic
                architecture and décor set it a class apart. It is one of the best Venice tourist attractions.
                Don’t Miss: Popular tourist attractions like Porta della Carta, Scala dei Giganti, gold vaulted Scala
                d’Oro, Sala del Collegio, and works of Tintoretto
            </p>

                alt="Basilica Di San Marco" height="200px" width="300px">
            <p>Basilica di San Marco or St Mark’s Basilica is one of the beautifully designed churches in Italy and
                Venice top attractions. The marvellous décor with gold mosaics and works by Renaissance painters and
                Byzantine domes are incredibly charming.
                Don’t Miss: Pala d’Oro (the golden altarpiece), mosaics designed by Titian & Tintoretto, and Quadriga of
                St Mark’s (a group of four bronze horses)
            </p>

                alt="Piazza San Marco" height="200px" width="300px">
            <p>Piazza San Marco is the most crowded public square and one of the most happening places to visit in
                Venice, located in front of St. Mark’s Basilica and Doge’s Palace. The square is separated from the
                palace by a small inland waterway, known as the Rio Batario. This is the place where all the government
                buildings and other offices are located in Venice. It is no doubt one of the best places to visit in
                Venice.

                columns, National Library of St. Mark’s, the Museum of Archaeology, and the Correr Museum
