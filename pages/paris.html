            <p><b>Paris: a mythical city...</b>
                There are a thousand things to do and see in Paris and however much time you have here, it won’t be
                enough:
                Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, stroll down the Champs Elysées, visit the Louvre, see many shows
                and exhibitions, or simply wander along the banks of the Seine...read in French in the Tuileries garden,
                and quite simply take the time to experience the Parisian way of life!
                Stepping into this whirlwind that takes you from frenzy to romanticism will leave you with enduring
                memories. You will be much more proficient in French, and you will become aware of your ability to
                communicate in the language of Molière.

                <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>

                <img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105473116/750/562/image.jpg" alt="Eiffel" width="300"

            <p>Well come on, you know what it is. Very probably the single most famous man-made structure in the entire
                world, the Eiffel Tower was originally erected as a temporary exhibit for the Exposition Universelle of
                1889 (it was due to be taken down in 1909). From its summit, you can enjoy heart-stopping views over all
                of Paris – and conversely, its iconic form is visible from most vantage points in the city. Aside from
                the new glass floor that was installed in 2014 – which is a real trip if you’re brave enough to walk
                across it – there’s also a panoramic champagne bar on the third floor, a brasserie and a
                Michelin-starred restaurant. At night, the Eiffel’s girders sparkle like fairy lights on a Christmas
                tree (every hour, on the hour).

                <h3>Musée d’Orsay </h3>

                <img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/103581711/750/562/image.jpg" alt="Eiffel" width="300"
                    height="200">
            </header>

            <p>Before it became a world-leading art gallery, the Musée d’Orsay was a major train station (the first
                electrified train station in the world, actually). But despite being a lovely building it couldn’t
                accommodate the ever-increasing size of trains, leading the French government to the ingenious idea to
                fill it with art instead. This is where art fans go for a full-on dose of the biggest and best names in
                Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Lap up all that colour, light and scenic views before also
                exploring the decorative art collections for Art Nouveau glamour. Lovely.

                <h3> Arc de Triomphe </h3>

            <p>Commissioned by Napoleon but not actually finished until 1836, the Arc de Triomphe is the mother of all
                war memorials. Give your legs a workout and climb the 284 steps to the top, where the views sweep in
                geometric splendour between the arc of La Défense and the Louvre. Although you may be more distracted by
                observing the remarkable Parisian driving techniques in evidence around the unmarked traffic island
                below: in fact, hire car drivers have to pay extra on the insurance if they’d like it to cover the
                roundabout. When you get back down to the ground, do spare a thought for the Unknown Soldier whose grave
                sits solemnly in the centre of the arch.

                <h3>Château de Versailles</h3>

            </header>

            <p>Once just a modest hunting lodge, the Château de Versailles can surely now lay claim to the title of the
                most sumptuous pad in France. It’s grown with each resident and now has an astonishing 2,300 rooms that
                have housed numerous members of the French royalty over the years. The majority of the lavish work was
                commissioned by Louis XIV in 1678. The Sun King is virtually synonymous with Versailles: he’s
                responsible for adding the wondrous Hall of Mirrors, as well as the elegant and expansive grounds. It
                can get busy at peak times, so book a skip-the-line ticket beforehand and arrive early.
