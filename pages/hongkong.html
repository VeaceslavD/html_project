        <h1>Description</h1>

        <div>
            <p><b>Hong Kong is a vibrant and cosmopolitan city located on the southern coast of China. It is a Special
                    Administrative Region (SAR) of China, which means it enjoys a high degree of autonomy and maintains
                    its
                    own legal and economic systems. Hong Kong is known for its stunning skyline, bustling streets, and a
                    mix
                    of Eastern and Western cultures.
                    The city is divided into different areas, with Hong Kong Island being the commercial and financial
                    hub.
                    It is home to many towering skyscrapers, luxury shopping malls, and the iconic Victoria Peak,
                    offering
                    panoramic views of the city. The Central District is the heart of Hong Kong's financial industry,
                    hosting numerous multinational corporations and banks.
                    Kowloon, located across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island, is another bustling part of the city.
                    It
                    is known for its lively markets, including the popular Temple Street Night Market, where visitors
                    can
                    find a wide range of goods, from clothing to electronics and street food. Mong Kok, a neighborhood
                    in
                    Kowloon, is famous for its bustling street markets and shopping streets.

            <p>There was a time when Hong Kong’s filmic output was only bested by Hollywood and Bollywood, and while
                it’s a less prodigious beast these days, the city’s film industry still once produced illustrious names
                like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, the Shaw Brothers, John Woo, and Wong Kar-wai. Avenue of Stars pays
                tribute to these figures and many others who have helped burnish Hong Kong’s cinematic legacy. Selfie
                opportunities come with sculptures of Hong Kong legends such as martial arts master Bruce Lee, as well
                as singer and actress Anita Mui. Even Hong Kong's beloved local cartoon character McDull has a prime
                spot in front of the Victoria Harbour skyline. Plus, you can check out over 100 handprint plaques set
                into the wooden handrails along the waterfront.

                <h3>The Big Buddha (Tian Tan Buddha)</h3>

            </header>

            <p>Tian Tan Buddha – or as it’s better known, the Big Buddha – is Hong Kong’s most recognisable and iconic
                landmark. It was 12 years in the making: 34 metres high, and accessible to visitors by over 200
                gruelling steps. Needless to say, be prepared for aching legs by the time you’re at the top. Just beside
                the Buddha is Po Lin Monastery, a wondrous, incense-filled sanctum that ranks among Buddhism’s most
                important institutions. And if that slog gives you an appetite, refuel at the neighbouring Ngong Ping
                Village.

                alt="Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden" width="300px" height="200px">
            <p>Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden spreads over 148 hectares of land on the northern slopes of Tai Mo Shan,
                Hong Kong’s highest mountain. The farm was originally established to aid poor farmers in the New
                Territories but has since metamorphosised into a nature conservation centre. Wander around the vegetable
                gardens and greenhouses, and learn about fascinating organic growth methods. It’s perfect for those
                trying to transition into a more sustainable living at home. Visit exotics animals like flamingos, deer
                and, if you’re lucky, the occasional porcupines and pangolins in the area surrounding the farm.

                music-filled performances at Adventureland, there’s plenty of magical fun to be had

            <p>It’s hard to miss this egg-shaped dome on the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront. The theatre dome makes up half of
                the Hong Kong Space Museum, along with two permanent exhibitions: Hall of the Cosmos and the Hall of
                Space Exploration. Visitors can enjoy documentary screenings under the curved ceiling of the
                planetarium, or head over to the main museum and discover plenty of action and gadgetry for space and
                science enthusiasts.
